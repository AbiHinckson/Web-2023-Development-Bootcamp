<h1>The Best Movies According to Abi</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Rodger and Hammerstein's Cinderella</h3>
<p>Brandy with braids as Cinderella, Whiteney Houston as the fairy godmother and Paolo Montalban as the hot prince. Enough said.</p>
<h3>AuDHD things</h3>
<p>Anoyingly as part of my autism, I realised why I've always struggled with answering these type of questions on the spot and end up saying nonsense (especially face to face). My brain takes it too seriously and automatically goes through every movie I've watched and tries to rank everything accordingly, which is very annoying and takes way too long. As it wants to make sure I'm answering as honestly as possible, while also trying to give as much variety as possible so the full spectrum of my likes/dislikes are on display. Which while lovely, goes against the whole point of it being a quick, fun and silly exercise. My brain in taking it too seriously, starts to get stressed at the fast pacedness of trying to quickly get an answer while also maintaining a facade of normalcy. Thus this harmnless silly exercise, now becomes stressful and actually starts to make me panic and therefore blurt out whatever comes to mind. Which upon reflection I'll realise is not an accurate portrayal of my top 3/5/10 favourite anything and makes me go over and over in my head all the different ways I could've done everything differently.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>To counteract this problem, I did try and keep a mental list of my top favourite things for different media at all times, so I could be prepared if challenged spontaneously. However this was when I was younger and naturally the more I watched/experienced, the harder it became to constantly keep it updated in my head. So I ended up giving that up and went back to struggling. </p> 
<p>Thankfully, as I grew older the likelihood of seriosuly being asked these questions diminished and it stopped being much of a thought. But now this exercise has annoyingly brought this issue back up, so I'm thinking I should do another list to be honest.</p>
<p>Maybe I could do one on my phone?!</p>
<p>Ok note to self - create a note on my phone of favourites for different media so I can use it use it if I'm ever caught out.</p>
<p>Bruh, you see how a simple exercise turned into something completely overblown and extra. For no reason at all. And I'm now getting deja vu. It would be nice if I got premonitions of me winning the lottery, and then actually winning the lottery a day later (heck I'll even be willing to wait a week). I feel like that'd be more useful than dreaming up failing at a simple exercise, and then going on to fail that simple exercise in real life. I'm just saying -_-</p>
